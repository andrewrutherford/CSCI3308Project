##Description

Our goal for this project is to use the Yelp API to provide a richer individual experience through maps, graphs and more personalized approach to recommendations. 

##Vision Statement

"Helping you go where you wanna go"

##Motivation

Making a more personalized Yelp experience that allows users to save their favorite places and enhanced graphical fidelity to location visualization.

##Risks

-Breaking one of Yelp's API use guidelines (https://www.yelp.com/developers/display_requirements)

-Calling API too many times 

-Never collaborated on GitHub before (pail4944)

###Mitigation Strategy

-Making sure we use Yelp's logos and buttons on every page

-Hopefully a low traffic count

-Good communication through Slack, GitHub and Pivotal Tracker (pail4944)
