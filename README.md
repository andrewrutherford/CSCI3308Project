# CSCI3308Project

Project Ideas:

  Byron - I was thinking that we could defimitely get familiar with html and javascript (if most of us already aren't) and create a nice webpage. The big thing that I think could be fun is finding a website that we or most of us have interest in and complie some of their api info into a useful tool of sorts. We could start brainstorming things that we are all interested in whether it be some outdoor activity, gaming, or perhaps even something connected to the university. Personally I've wanted to start using API from various sources but this could be a cool opportunity to do so. I think as long as we implement all of the things we have learned so far we could actually do something pretty cool. Let me know what you think guys!
